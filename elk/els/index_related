Thank you for sharing the commands and output, which confirm that the bulk indexing operation into the `clientips` index on your Elasticsearch cluster (`192.168.1.168:9201`) was successful. The response from the `curl` command shows `"errors": false` and five indexed documents, indicating that the client IP data was correctly ingested. The `cat -e /tmp/clientips_bulk.json` output verifies that the bulk file has proper newlines, resolving the previous `illegal_argument_exception` error caused by malformed formatting in the `elasticsearch-cli` attempt.

Given your production-grade RHEL/CentOS-like environment, with a three-node Elasticsearch cluster, Filebeat indexing PostgreSQL logs, and plans for Kibana, I’ll summarize the outcome, verify the indexed data, and provide next steps to ensure the `clientips` data is accessible in Kibana or other tools. I’ll keep the response concise, avoid Ubuntu references, and address how this integrates with your setup (e.g., Filebeat/PostgreSQL and the pending Logstash issue). Since this is part of the broader context of your Elasticsearch usage, I’ll also clarify how to proceed with the second part (e.g., Logstash error) if you’re ready.

### Summary of Outcome
- **Bulk Indexing Success**:
  - The `curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips/_bulk"` command successfully indexed five documents into the `clientips` index, as shown by:
    json
    {"errors":false,"took":0,"items":[...]}
    
  - Each item has `"result":"created"` and `"status":201`, confirming the documents were added.
  - The bulk file (`/tmp/clientips_bulk.json`) was correctly formatted with newlines, avoiding the previous `Malformed action/metadata` error.

- **Data Ingested**:
  - The indexed documents contain:
    - `{"client_ip":"172.21.0.5","env":"Development"}`
    - `{"client_ip":"172.21.2.113","env":"QA"}`
    - `{"client_ip":"172.21.2.162","env":"QA"}`
    - `{"client_ip":"172.21.3.15","env":"Production"}`
    - `{"client_ip":"172.21.3.16","env":"Production"}`

- **Context**:
  - This operation is separate from your Filebeat setup (indexing PostgreSQL logs to `.ds-pgsql-<hostname>-YYYY.MM.dd`), which is functioning correctly.
  - The `clientips` index is a standard Elasticsearch index (not a data stream), created automatically during the bulk request.

### Procedure: Verify and Use the Indexed Data

**Goal**: Confirm the `clientips` index contains the expected data, make it accessible in Kibana, and optionally apply lifecycle management for production use.

#### 1. Verify Indexed Data
Confirm the documents are searchable:

curl -s -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips/_search?pretty" | jq .


Expected output:
json
{
  "took": <milliseconds>,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 5,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 1.0,
    "hits": [
      {"_index": "clientips", "_id": "HAuGkJYBLf0Ar8OwS_73", "_source": {"client_ip": "172.21.0.5", "env": "Development"}},
      {"_index": "clientips", "_id": "HQuGkJYBLf0Ar8OwS_73", "_source": {"client_ip": "172.21.2.113", "env": "QA"}},
      {"_index": "clientips", "_id": "HguGkJYBLf0Ar8OwS_73", "_source": {"client_ip": "172.21.2.162", "env": "QA"}},
      {"_index": "clientips", "_id": "HwuGkJYBLf0Ar8OwS_73", "_source": {"client_ip": "172.21.3.15", "env": "Production"}},
      {"_index": "clientips", "_id": "IAuGkJYBLf0Ar8OwS_73", "_source": {"client_ip": "172.21.3.16", "env": "Production"}}
    ]
  }
}


Check document count:

curl -s -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips/_count" | jq .


Expected: `"count": 5`.

Verify index details:

curl -s -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/_cat/indices/clientips?v"


Example output:

health status index      uuid                   pri re rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   clientips  xyz789  1   1   0      5          0          10kb       10kb


If the search returns no documents or errors, check:
- Index settings: `curl -s -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips/_settings" | jq .`
- Cluster health: `curl -s -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/_cluster/health" | jq .`

#### 2. Configure Kibana
Visualize the `clientips` data in Kibana:
1. Access Kibana at `http://<kibana-server-ip>:5601`.
2. Navigate to **Management > Stack Management > Index Patterns**.
3. Create an index pattern: `clientips`.
4. Skip the time field (your data has no `@timestamp`) and save.
5. Go to **Discover** to view the `client_ip` and `env` fields.
6. Optionally, create a **Dashboard** or **Lens** visualization to analyze environments (e.g., count of IPs per `env`).

#### 3. Apply Index Lifecycle Management (Optional)
For production use, add an ILM policy to manage the `clientips` index, similar to your Filebeat setup (`pgsql_logs_policy`):

- **Create ILM Policy**:

curl -X PUT "http://192.168.1.168:9201/_ilm/policy/clientips_policy" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_size": "50gb",
            "max_age": "30d"
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'


- **Create Index Template**:

curl -X PUT "http://192.168.1.168:9201/_index_template/clientips" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "index_patterns": ["clientips"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "index": {
        "lifecycle.name": "clientips_policy",
        "number_of_shards": 1,
        "number_of_replicas": 1
      }
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "client_ip": { "type": "ip" },
        "env": { "type": "keyword" }
      }
    }
  }
}'


- **Reindex Existing Data** (to apply ILM):

curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.168:9201/_reindex" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "source": {"index": "clientips"},
  "dest": {"index": "clientips-reindexed"}
}'


Move to the new index:

curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips"
curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.168:9201/_aliases" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "actions": [
    {"add": {"index": "clientips-reindexed", "alias": "clientips"}}
  ]
}'


This ensures the `clientips` index is managed like your Filebeat indices (rollover after 50GB/30 days, delete after 90 days).

#### 4. Secure the Index (Production Consideration)
- **Restrict Access**:
  If your cluster has security enabled, ensure the user running `curl` has permissions for `clientips`:
  
  curl -u <username>:<password> -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/_security/user"
  
  Add permissions via Kibana or the Elasticsearch API if needed.

- **SELinux**:
  Ensure `curl` can connect:
  
  sudo setsebool -P http_client_connect 1

### Integration with Your Setup
- **Filebeat/PostgreSQL**:
  - The `clientips` index is independent of your Filebeat setup (indexing PostgreSQL logs to `.ds-pgsql-wentao-YYYY.MM.dd`). The successful bulk indexing confirms your cluster is operational, supporting both use cases.
  - The `kubernetes` issue in the Filebeat template (addressed previously) doesn’t affect `clientips`, as it uses a default Elasticsearch mapping.

- **Cluster Health**:
  - Your cluster is healthy (`green`, handling Filebeat and `clientips` indices). The bulk indexing success reinforces this.

- **Logstash Context**:
  - You mentioned a pending Logstash `Malformed escape pair` error (from dynamic `ilm_rollover_alias`). This bulk operation is unrelated, but we can address Logstash in the second part if you’re ready.

- **Kibana**:
  - The `clientips` data can be visualized alongside your PostgreSQL logs in Kibana, using separate index patterns (`pgsql-*` and `clientips`).

---

### Troubleshooting
If the search still shows no documents:
- **Refresh Index**: `curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips/_refresh"`
- **Check Mappings**: `curl -s -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips/_mapping" | jq .`
- **Verify IDs**: Search by ID (e.g., `HAuGkJYBLf0Ar8OwS_73`):
  
  curl -s -X GET "http://192.168.1.168:9201/clientips/_doc/HAuGkJYBLf0Ar8OwS_73?pretty" | jq .
  
- **Share Outputs**: Provide any errors, the output of `_search`, or your server’s distribution (if not RHEL/CentOS).

---

### Next Steps
- **Verify Data**: Run the search and count commands to confirm the five documents are accessible.
- **Set Up Kibana**: Create the `clientips` index pattern for visualization.
- **Apply ILM (Optional)**: Add lifecycle management if `clientips` will grow.
- **Second Part**: If ready, we can address the Logstash `Malformed escape pair` error or revisit the Filebeat `kubernetes` template issue. For Logstash, I’d suggest updating the `postgresql.conf` to use a static `ilm_rollover_alias` (e.g., `pgsql-logs`), as discussed earlier.
- **Clarify Workflow**: If `clientips` is part of a larger system (e.g., related to PostgreSQL or Logstash), share details to integrate it with your setup.

Please confirm the data is visible in Elasticsearch/Kibana or let me know if you want to proceed with the Logstash fix or another task. If any issues arise, share the relevant outputs (e.g., `_search`, `_count`, or errors).
