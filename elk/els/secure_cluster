For instance, you can use role-based access control (RBAC) to secure access to your Elasticsearch data and APIs. Here’s how you can create a role and assign it to a user:

1. Open the Kibana interface and navigate to Management > Security > Roles.
2. Click on ‘Create role’ and specify the role name.
3. In the ‘Cluster privileges’ section, add the necessary privileges.
4. In the ‘Index privileges’ section, specify the indices that this role can access and the operations it can perform.
5. Save the role and navigate to Management > Security > Users.
6. Create a new user or select an existing one, and assign the newly created role to this user.

Since Elasticsearch 8.0, X-Pack security features are enabled by default when bootstrapping a new cluster. In earlier versions, X-Pack security was disabled by default and had to be enabled explicitly by setting `xpack.security.enabled: true` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file.









elasticsearch-certutil ca -days 3650

This tool assists you in the generation of X.509 certificates and certificate
signing requests for use with SSL/TLS in the Elastic stack.

The 'ca' mode generates a new 'certificate authority'
This will create a new X.509 certificate and private key that can be used
to sign certificate when running in 'cert' mode.

Use the 'ca-dn' option if you wish to configure the 'distinguished name'
of the certificate authority

By default the 'ca' mode produces a single PKCS#12 output file which holds:
    * The CA certificate
    * The CA's private key

If you elect to generate PEM format certificates (the -pem option), then the output will
be a zip file containing individual files for the CA certificate and private key

Please enter the desired output file [elastic-stack-ca.p12]:
