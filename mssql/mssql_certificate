You need to generate the certificate by yourself, because the trusted certificate option is missing in SSRS GUI

Add the part into mssql.conf

[network]
tlscert = /var/opt/mssql/ssl/mssql.pem
tlskey = /var/opt/mssql/ssl/mssql.key
forceencryption = true

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 36500 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /var/opt/mssql/ssl/mssql.key -out /var/opt/mssql/ssl/mssql.pem -subj "/CN=172.17.55.68" -addext "extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth"
 
finally, above command fixed the issue, remember the two files should be 600

Then, need to add the pem key into windows mmc
- Open MMC (mmc > Add Snap-in > Certificates > Computer Account > Local Computer).
- Go to Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates.
- Find your certificate (look for CN=172.17.55.68).
- Double-click it and check:
- General tab: “This certificate is intended for the following purpose(s): Server Authentication” and “Valid from/to” includes today (February 22, 2025).
- Certification Path tab: Shows only one entry (CN=172.17.55.68) with “Certificate status: This certificate is OK.

Then, finally you can connect
