#Do you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda?
#This will activate conda on startup and change the command prompt when activated.
#If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
#   run the following command when conda is activated:
#
#conda config --set auto_activate_base false
# Note: You can undo this later by running `conda init --reverse $SHELL`
