1. boot sda IO, pretty high

High I/O on the `/boot` directory (which typically resides on device `/dev/sda1`) is unusual — it's a mostly static area that stores kernel and initramfs images. If you're getting high I/O alerts on it, here are some **possible causes** to investigate:

---

### 🔍 Common Causes of High `/boot` I/O

#### 1. **Frequent `initramfs` or kernel rebuilds**

* Check for repeated `dracut`, `mkinitcpio`, or `update-initramfs` runs.
* **Culprit:** Automatic updates (e.g., `dnf update`, `yum`, or unattended-upgrades) installing new kernels.

🧪 Check:

```bash
ls -ltr /boot
```

Look for frequent timestamp updates or growing number of `vmlinuz-*` and `initramfs-*` files.

---

#### 2. **Log-based security or monitoring tools accessing files**

* Some tools like **OSSEC**, **Tripwire**, **AIDE**, or antivirus might constantly read `/boot` for change detection.

🧪 Check who’s reading:

```bash
sudo lsof | grep '/boot'
```

---

#### 3. **Backup software including `/boot` in every backup**

* If backup tools (like `rsync`, `tar`, or snapshot-based tools) scan `/boot` often, they may cause spikes.

🧪 Check cron jobs or timers:

```bash
grep boot /etc/cron*/* /etc/systemd/system/*.timer 2>/dev/null
```

---

#### 4. **Filesystem issues or bad disk sectors**

* Failing sectors on `/dev/sda1` could trigger retries, increasing I/O.

🧪 Check disk health:

```bash
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
sudo dmesg | grep sda
```

---

#### 5. **GRUB or bootloader reconfiguration**

* Frequent updates to bootloader config (`grub.cfg`, `systemd-boot`, etc.) may involve rewriting to `/boot`.

🧪 Check:

```bash
ls -ltr /boot/grub*/grub.cfg
```

---

### 🛠️ If You Want to Monitor `/boot` Usage:

```bash
sudo iotop -oPa   # shows real-time per-process I/O
```

```bash
sudo iostat -xd 1 /dev/sda
```

---

### 🔒 What *should not* be writing to `/boot` frequently:

* Normal user activity.
* Applications or daemons (unless specifically working with kernel/initramfs).
* System updates more than once per kernel update cycle.

### ✅ Summary

| Cause                     | Investigate With               |               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Kernel/initramfs rebuilds | `ls -ltr /boot`, \`rpm -qa     | grep kernel\` |
| Backup software           | `lsof`, cron jobs, backup logs |               |
| Monitoring tools          | `lsof`, process list           |               |
| Disk issues               | `smartctl`, `dmesg`            |               |
| GRUB reconfigurations     | `ls -ltr /boot/grub*/grub.cfg` |               |
