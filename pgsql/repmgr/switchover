You have to follow the instruction, to add the systemd command into the configured service command part

1. Dry run to see whether the whole process is OK

[postgres@rl02 ~]$ repmgr standby switchover --siblings-follow --dry-run
NOTICE: checking switchover on node "rl02" (ID: 2) in --dry-run mode

INFO: following shutdown command would be run on node "rl01":
  "systemctl stop postgresql"
INFO: parameter "shutdown_check_timeout" is set to 60 seconds
INFO: prerequisites for executing STANDBY SWITCHOVER are met

2. repmgrd must be shutdown on all of the nodes before switchover

3. Remember to add --force-rewind -R option

4. repmgr standby switchover --siblings-follow --force-rewind

Better, but still, in the middle, new standby could not start, then, manually start, but this time, the slot handling is better, 
repmgr standby register --force
still need to run above






Run below command on standby node you want to promote

su - postgres -c "repmgr standby switchover --siblings-follow --force-rewind"

On new standby

su - postgres -c "repmgr -f /etc/repmgr/17/repmgr.conf node rejoin -h 192.168.1.168 -U repmgr -d repmgr --force-rewind"

But, always has issue. 

su - postgres -c "repmgr -f /etc/repmgr/17/repmgr.conf node rejoin -h 192.168.1.168 -U repmgr -d repmgr --force-rewind --force"

Always fail, we have to install witness node on pgpool node
