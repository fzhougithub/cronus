# stop instance on failed primary
systemctl stop postgresql

# make sure there is repl user

CREATE ROLE repl WITH REPLICATION PASSWORD 'repl1' LOGIN;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_read_binary_file(text) TO repl;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_ls_dir(text, boolean, boolean) TO repl;
GRANT pg_monitor TO repl;
But finally all of above does not work for pg_rewind

You have to setup password for postgresql and use it 


[root@rl01 mariadb]# grep archive /var/tellme/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
archive_mode = always           # enables archiving; off, on, or always
#archive_library = ''           # library to use to archive a WAL file
                                # (empty string indicates archive_command should
archive_command = 'test ! -f /var/tellme/pgsql/admin/arch/%f && cp %p /var/tellme/pgsql/admin/arch/%f'          # command to use to archive a WAL file
                                # placeholders: %p = path of file to archive
                                # e.g. 'test ! -f /mnt/server/archivedir/%f && cp %p /mnt/server/archivedir/%f'
#archive_timeout = 0            # force a WAL file switch after this
restore_command = 'cp /var/tellme/pgsql/admin/sarch/%f %p'              # command to use to restore an archived WAL file
                                # e.g. 'cp /mnt/server/archivedir/%f %p'
#archive_cleanup_command = ''   # command to execute at every restartpoint
#max_standby_archive_delay = 30s        # max delay before canceling queries
                                        # when reading WAL from archive;
# Make sure the repl can connect to the new primary before rewind

you have to modify .pgpass under postgres user

cat ~/.pgpass

192.168.1.80:5432:*:repl:repl1
192.168.1.80:5432:*:postgres:postgres1
# the pg_rewind will not auto start streaming replcation, so, you need to manually restart it after pg_rewind

# You need to run pg_rewind twice time, first time sync data, second time, using -R to bring config for standby
pg_rewind --target-pgdata=/var/tellme/pgsql/data --source-server="host=192.168.1.80 port=5432 user=repl dbname=postgres"

pg_rewind --target-pgdata=/var/tellme/pgsql/data --source-server="host=192.168.1.80 port=5432 user=repl dbname=postgres" -R

#Also, the primary connection string, suppose should be added into the new standby config, the pg_rewind will never update the config files
