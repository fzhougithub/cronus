Large table queries that can make other sessions slow and potentially trigger application retries typically involve operations that consume significant system resources (CPU, memory, I/O) or lock resources in a way that blocks other queries. Here are some common scenarios:

---

1. **Full Table Scans on Large Tables**
   • What happens: If a query performs a full table scan on a very large table without proper indexing, it can consume a lot of I/O and CPU resources, slowing down other queries.

   • Example: A query like `SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE some_column = 'value'` without an index on `some_column` will scan the entire table.

   • Impact: Other sessions may experience delays or timeouts, leading to retries.


---

2. **Expensive Aggregations or Joins**
   • What happens: Queries involving complex aggregations (e.g., `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`) or joins on large tables can consume a lot of memory and CPU.

   • Example: A query like `SELECT AVG(large_column) FROM very_large_table GROUP BY another_column` or a join between two large tables.

   • Impact: These queries can monopolize resources, causing other sessions to wait or retry.


---

3. **Lock Contention**
   • What happens: Queries that acquire exclusive locks (e.g., `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `ALTER TABLE`) on large tables can block other sessions trying to access the same data.

   • Example: A long-running `UPDATE` statement on a large table can lock rows or even the entire table, preventing other queries from proceeding.

   • Impact: Other sessions may time out or retry, especially if they are waiting for locks to be released.


---

4. **Vacuum and Autovacuum Operations**
   • What happens: PostgreSQL's `VACUUM` and `AUTOVACUUM` processes reclaim storage from dead tuples (rows that are no longer visible to any transaction). If these operations are running on a large table, they can consume significant resources.

   • Example: A long-running `VACUUM` on a large table can slow down other queries.

   • Impact: Other sessions may experience delays or retries, especially if the vacuum operation is aggressive.


---

5. **Index Scans on Large Tables with High Cardinality**
   • What happens: If an index scan is performed on a column with high cardinality (many unique values) in a large table, it can still be slow if the index is not properly optimized or if the query is poorly written.

   • Example: A query like `SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE indexed_column = 'value'` might still be slow if the index is fragmented or if the query is not selective enough.

   • Impact: Other sessions may experience delays if the index scan consumes significant resources.


---

6. **Parallel Queries**
   • What happens: Parallel queries can consume multiple CPU cores and memory, potentially starving other sessions of resources.

   • Example: A query like `SELECT /*+ PARALLEL(large_table, 4) */ * FROM large_table WHERE some_condition` might use 4 CPU cores, leaving fewer resources for other queries.

   • Impact: Other sessions may experience slowdowns or retries, especially if the system is under heavy load.


---

7. **Long-Running Transactions**
   • What happens: Transactions that hold locks for a long time (e.g., due to uncommitted updates or long-running reads) can block other sessions.

   • Example: A session that starts a transaction, performs a long-running operation, and then forgets to commit or roll back.

   • Impact: Other sessions may time out or retry while waiting for the locks to be released.


---

8. **Excessive Sorting or Temporary Tables**
   • What happens: Queries that require sorting or the use of temporary tables (e.g., `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, or `GROUP BY` on large datasets) can consume a lot of memory and disk I/O.

   • Example: A query like `SELECT DISTINCT large_column FROM very_large_table ORDER BY another_column` might spill to disk if the result set is too large.

   • Impact: Other sessions may experience delays or retries due to resource contention.


---

9. **Unoptimized Queries**
   • What happens: Poorly written queries (e.g., missing indexes, unnecessary joins, or Cartesian products) can perform poorly on large tables.

   • Example: A query like `SELECT * FROM table1, table2` without a join condition will perform a Cartesian product, which is extremely slow on large tables.

   • Impact: Other sessions may experience delays or retries due to resource contention.


---

10. **High Concurrency**
   • What happens: If many sessions are querying the same large table simultaneously, the database may struggle to handle the load, leading to contention.

   • Example: Multiple sessions running `SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE some_condition` at the same time.

   • Impact: Sessions may experience delays or retries due to resource contention.

How to Mitigate These Issues:
1. Indexing: Ensure that frequently queried columns are indexed.
2. Query Optimization: Optimize queries to reduce their resource usage (e.g., avoid full table scans, use efficient joins).
3. Partitioning: Partition large tables to reduce the amount of data scanned.
4. Resource Limits: Set resource limits (e.g., `work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`) to prevent queries from consuming too many resources.
5. Monitoring: Use tools like `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_locks` to monitor long-running queries and locks.
6. Vacuum Tuning: Adjust `autovacuum` settings to ensure it runs efficiently without causing contention.
7. Connection Pooling: Use a connection pooler (e.g., PgBouncer) to manage database connections and reduce contention.

By addressing these issues, you can minimize the impact of large table queries on other sessions and reduce the likelihood of application retries.
