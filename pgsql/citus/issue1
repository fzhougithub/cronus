The performance of the statement:

```sql
SELECT row_to_json(q1.*) INTO v_return_json
FROM (
    SELECT string_to_array(string_agg(bookmark_name, ',' ORDER BY bookmark_name), ',') AS bookmark_name
    FROM user_filter_bookmarks
    WHERE user_id = p_in_user_id
) q1;
```

depends on several factors, including the size of the `user_filter_bookmarks` table, the number of rows matching the `WHERE` condition (`user_id = p_in_user_id`), and the overall load on the database. Let's break it down:

---

**Potential Performance Concerns**
1. Aggregation (`string_agg`) and Array Conversion (`string_to_array`):
   • The `string_agg` function concatenates all `bookmark_name` values for a given `user_id`, separated by commas.

   • The `string_to_array` function then converts the concatenated string back into an array.

   • These operations can be computationally expensive, especially if there are many rows for the given `user_id`.


2. Sorting (`ORDER BY bookmark_name`):
   • The `ORDER BY` clause ensures that the `bookmark_name` values are sorted before concatenation.

   • Sorting can add overhead, particularly if the number of rows is large.


3. Table Size and Indexing:
   • If the `user_filter_bookmarks` table is very large, the query may need to scan a significant portion of the table to find rows matching the `WHERE` condition.

   • If there is no index on the `user_id` column, the query will perform a full table scan, which can be slow.


4. Row-to-JSON Conversion (`row_to_json`):
   • The `row_to_json` function converts the result of the subquery into a JSON object.

   • This operation is generally efficient, but it adds some overhead, especially if the subquery returns a large result set.

**Optimization Strategies**
To mitigate potential performance issues, consider the following:

1. Indexing:
   • Ensure that there is an index on the `user_id` column in the `user_filter_bookmarks` table. This will speed up the filtering process.

   • Example:

     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_user_filter_bookmarks_user_id ON user_filter_bookmarks(user_id);
     ```

2. Limit the Number of Rows:
   • If possible, limit the number of rows processed by the query. For example, if you only need the top N bookmarks, use a `LIMIT` clause.


3. Avoid Unnecessary Operations:
   • If the `string_to_array` and `string_agg` operations are not strictly necessary, consider simplifying the query. For example, if you only need a comma-separated string, you can skip the `string_to_array` step.


4. Analyze Query Performance:
   • Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to analyze the query's execution plan and identify bottlenecks.

   • Example:

     ```sql
     EXPLAIN ANALYZE
     SELECT row_to_json(q1.*) 
     FROM (
         SELECT string_to_array(string_agg(bookmark_name, ',' ORDER BY bookmark_name), ',') AS bookmark_name
         FROM user_filter_bookmarks
         WHERE user_id = p_in_user_id
     ) q1;
     ```

5. Batch Processing:
   • If the query is part of a larger operation, consider processing data in batches to reduce the load on the database.

**When This Statement Might Cause Performance Issues**
• Large Table: If `user_filter_bookmarks` contains millions of rows, the query could take a long time to execute.

• High Frequency of Execution: If this query is executed frequently (e.g., in a loop or for many users), it could lead to contention and slow down the database.

• No Index on `user_id`: Without an index, the query will perform a full table scan, which is inefficient.


---

**When This Statement Is Likely Fine**
• Small Table: If `user_filter_bookmarks` has only a few thousand rows, the query should execute quickly.

• Efficient Indexing: If there is an index on `user_id`, the filtering operation will be fast.

• Low Frequency of Execution: If this query is executed infrequently, its impact on performance will be minimal.


---

**Conclusion**
The statement could cause performance issues if the `user_filter_bookmarks` table is large, lacks an index on `user_id`, or is executed frequently. To ensure good performance:
1. Add an index on `user_id`.
2. Analyze the query's execution plan using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
3. Consider simplifying the query if possible.

If you provide more context about the size of the table and the frequency of execution, I can offer more specific advice!
