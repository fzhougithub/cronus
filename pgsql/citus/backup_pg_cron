No, `pg_dump` does not back up `pg_cron` tasks by default. `pg_cron` is an extension that schedules periodic tasks in PostgreSQL, and its tasks are stored in the `cron.job` table. Since `pg_dump` only backs up the schema and data of the database (as defined by the tables, views, functions, etc.), it does not include the `pg_cron` tasks unless explicitly included in the backup.

To back up `pg_cron` tasks, you need to manually export the contents of the `cron.job` table. Here's how you can do it:

**Steps to Backup `pg_cron` Tasks**

1. Export the `cron.job` Table:
   Use the `pg_dump` command with the `-t` option to back up only the `cron.job` table. For example:
   ```bash
   pg_dump -U your_username -h your_host -d your_database -t cron.job -f pg_cron_tasks.sql
   ```
   This will create a SQL file (`pg_cron_tasks.sql`) containing the `cron.job` table and its data.

2. Manually Export the `cron.job` Table:
   If you don't want to use `pg_dump`, you can manually export the `cron.job` table using a SQL query:
   ```sql
   COPY (SELECT * FROM cron.job) TO '/path/to/pg_cron_tasks.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
   ```
   This will save the `cron.job` table data to a CSV file.

3. Backup the `pg_cron` Extension:
   If you need to restore the `pg_cron` extension itself, ensure that the extension is installed in the target database after restoring the backup. You can install it using:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
   ```

**Restoring `pg_cron` Tasks**

To restore the `pg_cron` tasks, you need to:
1. Restore the `cron.job` table data.
2. Reapply the tasks in the `cron.job` table.

Option 1: Using the SQL File
If you used `pg_dump` to back up the `cron.job` table, you can restore it using:
```bash
psql -U your_username -h your_host -d your_database -f pg_cron_tasks.sql
```

Option 2: Using the CSV File
If you exported the `cron.job` table to a CSV file, you can restore it using:
```sql
COPY cron.job FROM '/path/to/pg_cron_tasks.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

**Important Notes**
• Permissions: Ensure that the user performing the backup and restore has the necessary permissions to access the `cron.job` table.

• Database Compatibility: The `cron.job` table structure may vary slightly depending on the version of `pg_cron`. Ensure compatibility when restoring.

• Dependencies: If the `pg_cron` tasks depend on specific database objects (e.g., functions, tables), ensure those objects are also backed up and restored.


By following these steps, you can effectively back up and restore `pg_cron` tasks in PostgreSQL.
