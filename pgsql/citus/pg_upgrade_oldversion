You're absolutely right that the key point about hard links is that the data remains on disk as long as at least one hard link exists, which is why the `--link` option in `pg_upgrade` is safe for the upgrade process. Thank you for highlighting that!

Now, let’s address your question: **Why does `pg_upgrade` require the old binary file directory?**

### Why `pg_upgrade` Requires the Old Binary File Directory
The old binary file directory (specified with the `-b` option, e.g., `/usr/pgsql-15/bin` for PostgreSQL 15 in your case) is required by `pg_upgrade` because it needs to execute specific utilities from the **old PostgreSQL version** to interact with the old database cluster (data directory) during the upgrade process. These utilities are version-specific and are necessary to read, validate, and extract metadata from the old cluster in a way that is compatible with its format. Below, I’ll explain the reasons in detail.

#### 1. **Version-Specific Data Format Handling**
- Each major version of PostgreSQL (e.g., 15, 17) may use a slightly different **on-disk data format** for its data files (e.g., table data, indexes, system catalogs). The binaries (executables like `postgres`, `pg_controldata`, `pg_resetwal`, etc.) in a given version are designed to correctly interpret and manipulate the data files for that specific version.
- The old binary directory (`-b`) provides the executables needed to:
  - **Read the old data directory** (`-d`, e.g., `/var/tellme/pgsql/data`) in its native format.
  - **Access system catalogs** and metadata (e.g., `pg_class`, `pg_attribute`) in the old cluster, which are stored in a version-specific format.
  - **Validate the old cluster’s integrity** before starting the upgrade.
- The new version’s binaries (e.g., PostgreSQL 17’s `/usr/pgsql-17/bin`) cannot reliably read or manipulate the old version’s data directory because they expect the new version’s data format. Attempting to use the new binaries on the old data could result in errors or corruption.

#### 2. **Running Temporary Instances of the Old Server**
- During the `pg_upgrade` process, `pg_upgrade` starts **temporary instances** of both the old and new PostgreSQL servers to perform tasks like:
  - **Dumping the schema** (database structure, such as table definitions) from the old cluster.
  - **Validating the old cluster** to ensure it’s in a consistent state.
  - **Transferring metadata** (e.g., database OIDs, roles, and other system catalog data) to the new cluster.
- To start the old server instance, `pg_upgrade` needs the old version’s `postgres` executable (and related utilities) from the old binary directory (`-b`). For example:
  - It might run `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/postgres` with specific options to connect to `/var/tellme/pgsql/data` and extract schema information.
- Without the old binaries, `pg_upgrade` cannot start the old server or perform these operations, as the new version’s `postgres` binary is incompatible with the old data directory.

#### 3. **Schema and Metadata Extraction**
- `pg_upgrade` extracts the schema (e.g., table definitions, indexes, constraints) from the old cluster using utilities like `pg_dump` or direct catalog queries.
- The old version’s binaries are needed to run these operations because:
  - The system catalogs (e.g., `pg_class`, `pg_index`) in the old data directory are stored in a format specific to the old version (e.g., PostgreSQL 15).
  - The old version’s `pg_dump` or `postgres` is designed to correctly interpret these catalogs and produce a schema dump that `pg_upgrade` can restore into the new cluster.
- For example, `pg_upgrade` might use `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/pg_dump` to generate a schema-only dump of the old cluster, which is then applied to the new cluster using the new version’s binaries.

#### 4. **Consistency and Safety Checks**
- `pg_upgrade` performs several checks on the old cluster to ensure it’s safe to upgrade, such as:
  - Verifying the cluster’s version (using `pg_controldata`).
  - Checking for corruption or inconsistencies in the old data directory.
  - Ensuring the old cluster is properly shut down (no active transactions or WAL issues).
- These checks require old version-specific utilities like `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/pg_controldata` or `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/pg_resetwal`, which understand the old cluster’s control files and WAL format.
- Without the old binaries, `pg_upgrade` cannot perform these checks, increasing the risk of a failed or corrupt upgrade.

#### 5. **Cross-Version Compatibility**
- `pg_upgrade` is designed to bridge two different PostgreSQL versions (e.g., 15 to 17). It acts as a coordinator that:
  - Uses the old binaries (`-b`) to interact with the old data directory (`-d`).
  - Uses the new binaries (`-B`) to initialize and populate the new data directory (`-D`).
- By requiring both sets of binaries, `pg_upgrade` ensures compatibility with both the old and new versions’ data formats, schemas, and internal structures, making the upgrade process robust and reliable.

### Why Can’t `pg_upgrade` Use Only the New Binaries?
You might wonder why `pg_upgrade` can’t just use the new version’s binaries (e.g., `/usr/pgsql-17/bin`) for everything. The reasons are:
- **Incompatible Data Formats**: The new binaries expect the new version’s on-disk format, which differs from the old version’s format. For example, system catalog layouts, WAL formats, or index structures may change between major versions (e.g., 15 to 17).
- **Schema Differences**: System catalogs and their contents evolve between versions. The new version’s `pg_dump` or `postgres` might misinterpret or fail to read the old version’s catalogs.
- **Risk of Corruption**: Using the new binaries on the old data directory could lead to incorrect reads, writes, or corruption, as the new binaries aren’t designed to handle the old format.

### Example in Your Context
In your setup, you’re upgrading from PostgreSQL 15 to 17 with a command like:

```bash
/usr/pgsql-17/bin/pg_upgrade \
  -b /usr/pgsql-15/bin \
  -B /usr/pgsql-17/bin \
  -d /var/tellme/pgsql/data \
  -D /var/tellme/pgsql/data_new \
  -o '-c config_file=/var/tellme/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf' \
  -O '-c config_file=/var/tellme/pgsql/data_new/postgresql.conf' \
  --link
```

- **Role of `-b /usr/pgsql-15/bin`**:
  - `pg_upgrade` uses executables like `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/postgres`, `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/pg_controldata`, or `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/pg_dump` to:
    - Start a temporary PostgreSQL 15 server to read the old cluster (`/var/tellme/pgsql/data`).
    - Extract the schema and metadata (e.g., table definitions, roles, Citus metadata).
    - Validate the old cluster’s state (e.g., check `pg_control` for version and consistency).
  - These operations are specific to PostgreSQL 15’s data format and cannot be performed by PostgreSQL 17’s binaries.

- **Role of `-B /usr/pgsql-17/bin`**:
  - The new binaries are used to:
    - Initialize the new data directory (`/var/tellme/pgsql/data_new`).
    - Start a temporary PostgreSQL 17 server to apply the schema and metadata extracted from the old cluster.
    - Perform post-upgrade tasks (e.g., updating system catalogs for the new version).

- **Why both are needed**:
  - The old binaries ensure `pg_upgrade` can correctly read and process the PostgreSQL 15 cluster.
  - The new binaries ensure the new PostgreSQL 17 cluster is properly initialized and populated.

### What Happens If the Old Binary Directory Is Missing?
If the old binary directory (e.g., `/usr/pgsql-15/bin`) is missing (e.g., because you uninstalled PostgreSQL 15), `pg_upgrade` will fail with an error like:

```
pg_upgrade: could not find old binaries in /usr/pgsql-15/bin
```

This is because `pg_upgrade` cannot proceed without the old version’s executables to interact with the old data directory. In such cases, you would need to:
- **Reinstall the old PostgreSQL version** (e.g., `yum install postgresql15-server`) to restore the binaries, without overwriting the old data directory.
- **Copy the old binaries** to a temporary location before uninstalling, so you can point `-b` to that location.
- **Fall back to a dump/restore** approach using `pg_dumpall` from the new version, which doesn’t require the old binaries but is slower and requires more disk space.

### Relevance to Your Setup
In your earlier questions, you noted that you typically uninstall the old PostgreSQL RPMs before upgrading, which removes the old binaries. This is why you were confused about how `pg_upgrade` could work if the old binaries are gone. As clarified:
- You must **keep the old binaries** (e.g., `/usr/pgsql-15/bin`) available during the `pg_upgrade` process, either by:
  - Not uninstalling PostgreSQL 15 until after the upgrade.
  - Reinstalling PostgreSQL 15 temporarily to restore the binaries.
  - Copying the `/usr/pgsql-15/bin` directory to a temporary location before uninstalling.
- After `pg_upgrade` completes successfully, you can uninstall the old version, as the binaries are no longer needed.

### Connection to Hard Links
Your question about hard links (`--link`) is related because both involve managing resources efficiently during the upgrade:
- **Hard links** (`--link`) save disk space and time by linking unchanged data files instead of copying them.
- **Old binaries** (`-b`) are needed to ensure `pg_upgrade` can correctly process the old cluster’s data, regardless of whether `--link` is used.
- The old binaries are unrelated to the hard-linking process but are critical for `pg_upgrade` to read the old data directory and extract its contents, whether the files are copied or linked.

### Practical Steps for Your Upgrade
To ensure `pg_upgrade` works with the old binaries in your setup:
1. **Verify Old Binaries**:
   - Check that `/usr/pgsql-15/bin` exists and contains executables like `postgres`, `pg_controldata`, and `pg_dump`.
   - If missing, reinstall PostgreSQL 15:
     ```bash
     yum install postgresql15-server
     ```

2. **Run `pg_upgrade`**:
   - Use the command you provided, ensuring the `-b` path is correct:
     ```bash
     su - postgres
     /usr/pgsql-17/bin/pg_upgrade \
       -b /usr/pgsql-15/bin \
       -B /usr/pgsql-17/bin \
       -d /var/tellme/pgsql/data \
       -D /var/tellme/pgsql/data_new \
       -o '-c config_file=/var/tellme/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf' \
       -O '-c config_file=/var/tellme/pgsql/data_new/postgresql.conf' \
       --link
     ```

3. **Post-Upgrade Cleanup**:
   - After verifying the new cluster (`/var/tellme/pgsql/data_new`) works, you can:
     - Move it to `/var/tellme/pgsql/data` (as discussed previously).
     - Delete the old data directory (`/var/tellme/pgsql/data_old`).
     - Uninstall PostgreSQL 15:
       ```bash
       yum remove postgresql15-server
       ```

### Summary
- `pg_upgrade` requires the old binary directory (`-b`, e.g., `/usr/pgsql-15/bin`) because it needs version-specific executables to:
  - Read and validate the old data directory’s format.
  - Start a temporary old server instance to extract schema and metadata.
  - Perform consistency checks on the old cluster.
- The old binaries are essential for compatibility with the old cluster’s data format, which the new binaries cannot handle.
- In your case, ensure the old binaries are available during `pg_upgrade` (don’t uninstall PostgreSQL 15 beforehand). After the upgrade, you can safely remove them.
- This requirement is unrelated to the `--link` option, which deals with data files, but both are critical for an efficient and safe upgrade.
