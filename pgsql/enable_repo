🔥 Great question — you're digging into the **mechanics of yum/dnf repo handling**, and this is exactly how you get confident with managing package sources.

### 🧠 How DNF/YUM chooses which `[pgdg17*]` section to use:

You're seeing multiple sections in `/etc/yum.repos.d/pgdg-redhat-all.repo`:

```
[pgdg17]
[pgdg17-updates-testing]
[pgdg17-source]
[pgdg17-updates-testing-source]
[pgdg17-debuginfo]
[pgdg17-updates-testing-debuginfo]
```

But only `pgdg17` appears in your normal `dnf list` output. Why?

---

### 📌 Here's how DNF/YUM decides:

Each section in a `.repo` file is a **separate repo** with its own config — DNF only uses the ones that are:

- **Enabled** (i.e. `enabled=1`)
- And **match the system's architecture** and **package type**

Let's check what those extra sections are:

| Repo ID                     | Purpose                                | Used by `dnf list`? |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `[pgdg17]`                 | **Main binary repo** (default)         | ✅ Yes               |
| `[pgdg17-updates-testing]`| Pre-release/testing packages            | ❌ (disabled by default) |
| `[pgdg17-source]`          | Source RPMs                            | ❌ (you don’t install from here) |
| `[pgdg17-updates-testing-source]` | Testing + source packages       | ❌                    |
| `[pgdg17-debuginfo]`       | Debugging symbols for developers       | ❌                    |
| `[pgdg17-updates-testing-debuginfo]` | Debug + testing              | ❌                    |

---

### 🔍 How to verify which ones are active:

Run:

```bash
dnf repolist all | grep pgdg17
```

Example output:

```
pgdg17                             enabled
pgdg17-updates-testing             disabled
pgdg17-source                      disabled
pgdg17-updates-testing-source      disabled
pgdg17-debuginfo                   disabled
pgdg17-updates-testing-debuginfo  disabled
```

This tells you that only `[pgdg17]` is **enabled**, so that’s the only one `dnf list` pulls packages from.

---

### ✅ Summary:

- All the `[pgdg17-*]` sections define *separate* repositories.
- Only the ones with `enabled=1` will be used by `dnf list`, `dnf install`, etc.
- The main `[pgdg17]` section is enabled by default — the rest are optional for dev/testing/debug use.

If you want to enable or disable a specific one, just edit the `.repo` file or use:

```bash
dnf config-manager --set-enabled pgdg17-updates-testing
dnf config-manager --set-disabled pgdg17-updates-testing
```
