While PostgreSQL doesn't have an exact feature called "SQL Plan Baselines" like Oracle does, the concept you're recalling sounds very much like using **exported and imported statistics (or a similar mechanism for optimizer hints/reproduction)** to simulate a production environment on a smaller development or testing database for query tuning.

In Oracle, **SQL Plan Baselines** allow you to capture a specific execution plan for a SQL statement and then "evolve" or "fix" that plan, ensuring the optimizer always uses that plan even if statistics change. This isn't precisely about importing statistics from a production database, but rather about managing and forcing specific execution plans.

What you're more likely thinking of, which is more directly about simulating a production environment's query performance on a smaller database, revolves around:

1. **Exporting/Importing Optimizer Statistics:** Getting the table and index statistics from the large production database and applying them to your smaller development database.
2. **Using `ANALYZE` with `FROM` clause:** In some database systems, you might be able to create statistics that reflect a larger dataset, even if the actual data is smaller.
3. **Generating Representative Data:** Sometimes, rather than importing statistics, you might use data generation tools to create a statistically similar (but smaller) dataset.

Let's see how these concepts translate to PostgreSQL and what Oracle features might have inspired your memory.

Here are some searches to help recall and explain these methods:

1. What are SQL Plan Baselines in Oracle Database and how are they used?
2. How to export and import optimizer statistics in Oracle for query tuning?
3. Does PostgreSQL have a feature similar to Oracle's SQL Plan Baselines?
4. How can I simulate a large production database's statistics on a smaller PostgreSQL development environment for query tuning?
   You're remembering **Oracle's SQL Plan Baselines** and the related ability to **export and import optimizer statistics**. This is a powerful feature in Oracle that allows DBAs to manage and stabilize execution plans, even across different database instances.

Here's a breakdown of what that Oracle approach entails and how you'd achieve a similar goal in PostgreSQL:

### Oracle's Approach: SQL Plan Baselines and Statistics Export/Import

1. **SQL Plan Baselines (SPM - SQL Plan Management):**
   
   - **What it is:** This is a mechanism in Oracle that allows you to *capture* a known good execution plan for a SQL statement. Once captured, the optimizer will prioritize using this baseline plan. If the optimizer later finds a *new* plan that it deems better, it won't immediately switch to it. Instead, it will add the new plan to the baseline as "unaccepted." You can then manually (or automatically in newer Oracle versions) "evolve" the baseline by verifying if the new plan is indeed better and then accepting it.
   - **How it helps simulation:** While not directly about simulating data size, baselines ensure that a specific query will execute with a specific plan. If you've identified a problematic plan on a production system, you could potentially transfer that plan to a development environment.
   - **Transferring Baselines:** Oracle provides `DBMS_SPM` procedures (like `PACK_STGTAB_BASELINE` and `UNPACK_STGTAB_BASELINE`) that allow you to move baselines between databases using a staging table and Data Pump (Oracle's export/import utility).

2. **Optimizer Statistics Export/Import:**
   
   - **What it is:** This is perhaps closer to what you're thinking for "creating customer statistics to load into a small database." Oracle's Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO) relies heavily on statistics about tables, columns, and indexes (e.g., number of rows, distinct values, data distribution, histogram data). If your development database has very little data, its statistics will be drastically different from a production database with terabytes of data.
   - **How it helps simulation:** By exporting the optimizer statistics from your large production database using `DBMS_STATS.EXPORT_SCHEMA_STATS` (or `EXPORT_TABLE_STATS`) into a staging table, and then importing that staging table and loading the statistics into your smaller development database (`DBMS_STATS.IMPORT_SCHEMA_STATS`), you can trick the optimizer on the small database into *thinking* it's working with a large production-sized dataset. This allows it to generate similar execution plans to what you'd see in production.
   - **Benefits:** You can tune queries on a smaller, safer, and faster-to-refresh environment, expecting that the optimized plans will also work well in production.

### PostgreSQL's Approach to Simulating Production for Query Tuning

PostgreSQL doesn't have direct equivalents for SQL Plan Baselines or the direct export/import of optimizer statistics. However, it offers alternative strategies to achieve similar goals for query tuning:

1. Replicating Statistics (The Closest Equivalent):
   
   This is the most direct way to achieve what you're describing in PostgreSQL. The idea is to make the optimizer on your small dev database believe it has the same data distribution as production.
   
   - **How it works:**
     
     1. **Identify key tables:** Determine which tables are involved in the slow queries you're trying to tune.
     
     2. **Get `pg_stats` data:** On the production database, extract the statistics from the `pg_stats` system view (and potentially `pg_statistic_ext` for extended statistics). `pg_stats` contains detailed information about column `null_frac`, `avg_width`, `n_distinct`, `most_common_vals`, `most_common_freqs`, `histogram_bounds`, etc.
     
     3. **Manually create/update statistics on dev:** On your smaller development database (with representative *schema* but not necessarily all the *data*):
        
        - You could theoretically populate dummy data in your dev tables, and then run `ANALYZE` on them.
        - However, if you want to explicitly mimic *production* statistics on a small dev database, you'd have to construct `ALTER TABLE ... SET STATISTICS ...` commands and manually update `pg_statistic` (which is highly discouraged directly).
        - **The more practical approach is often to use a small *sample* of production data.** Take a subset of your production data (e.g., using `TABLESAMPLE` or careful `WHERE` clauses to extract recent data) and load it into your development database. Then, run `ANALYZE` on this representative (but smaller) dataset. If the sample is statistically representative, the `ANALYZE` will produce similar statistics.
     
     4. **Adjust `reltuples` and `relpages`:** The `pg_class` catalog stores `reltuples` (estimated number of live rows) and `relpages` (estimated number of pages). For very large tables, you might manually update these values on your development database to match production values. This directly impacts the optimizer's cost calculations. You'd need to be very careful doing this as it requires superuser privileges and can be risky.
        
        SQL
        
        ```
        -- Example (use with extreme caution on dev, NEVER prod)
        ALTER TABLE your_table SET (reltuples = <prod_reltuples>, relpages = <prod_relpages>);
        -- Then run ANALYZE to update other statistics
        ANALYZE your_table;
        ```

2. **`pg_stat_statements` for Real-World Plans:**
   
   - **What it is:** This is a powerful PostgreSQL extension that tracks execution statistics of all queries run on your database. It includes `min_time`, `max_time`, `mean_time`, `calls`, `rows`, and importantly, the `queryid` (a hash of the normalized query string).
   - **How it helps:** You can identify the exact queries causing problems in production and their typical performance characteristics. You then take those exact queries and run them on your tuned development environment, comparing `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output. While it doesn't transfer the *plan* directly, it helps you recreate the conditions to *generate* the same plan.

3. **`pg_hint_plan` (Third-Party Extension for Hints):**
   
   - **What it is:** While PostgreSQL's philosophy is to rely on its powerful optimizer, `pg_hint_plan` is a popular extension that allows you to provide hints (similar to Oracle hints) to force the optimizer to use specific join methods, index scans, or join orders.
   - **How it helps simulation:** If you've identified a *specific plan* from production (via `EXPLAIN`) that you know works well, you can use `pg_hint_plan` in your development environment to force the optimizer to use that exact plan, even if your local statistics or data size might otherwise lead to a different plan. This allows you to test fixes or modifications against a known good (or bad) plan.

4. **Data Generation Tools:**
   
   - For testing very large tables from scratch, tools like `pgbench` (for simple workloads), custom Python/Perl scripts, or specialized data generation tools can be used to create datasets that are statistically similar to production in terms of data distribution, even if they contain fewer total rows.

**In summary:**

While Oracle has formal mechanisms (`DBMS_STATS` procedures for statistics, `DBMS_SPM` for baselines) that streamline this process, PostgreSQL's approach often involves:

- Carefully extracting and understanding production statistics (from `pg_stats`).
- Either populating a statistically representative subset of data on dev.
- Or, in some cases, manually tweaking `reltuples`/`relpages` (with extreme caution).
- Leveraging tools like `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_hint_plan` to analyze and guide the optimizer.

The key idea is the same: providing the development optimizer with enough accurate information (or explicit guidance) to generate plans that mimic those in production.
