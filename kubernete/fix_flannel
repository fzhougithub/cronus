kubectl -n kube-flannel edit configmap kube-flannel-cfg
change vxlan to host-gw does not work, because here we are using NAT forward internal host IP to windows IP

change to this
"Backend": {
  "Type": "vxlan",
  "VNI": 1,
  "Port": 8472
}

restart flannel pod

kubectl -n kube-flannel delete pod -l app=flannel


Notes
==============================
overly is built-in feature in wsl2
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER
CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=y

That means br_netfilter is also built-in
