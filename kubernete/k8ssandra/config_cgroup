Since Linux v5.0, kernel boot option cgroup_no_v1=<list_of_controllers_to_disable> can be used to disable cgroup v1 hierarchies. As a result, your machine should start as cgroup v2 only.

By following WSL documentation, we have to append %UserProfile%\.wslconfig file with:

[wsl2]
kernelCommandLine = cgroup_no_v1=all
That's it.
Just make sure you reboot your WSL instance with the > wsl.exe --shutdown command to pick up new settings.
You can check the list of enabled controllers in <cgroup_fs_mount_point>/cgroup.controllers file.

Extra tweaks:
By default, cgroup2 will likely be mounted at /sys/fs/cgroup/unified. Some apps might not like it (docker in particular). Move it to the conventional place with:
$ mount --move /sys/fs/cgroup/unified /sys/fs/cgroup
You can achieve similar effect by editing /etc/fstab file:
cgroup2 /sys/fs/cgroup cgroup2 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,nsdelegate 0 0
The receipt #2 has one side-effect where the original cgroup mount point at /sys/fs/cgroup/unified keps "dangling". You could check that by running $ mount | grep cgroup2 or look at /proc/self/mountinfo file. The upside of #2 is that docker service now starts without issues. So, if you can tolerate dangling mounts, the /etc/fstab method is preferred.
