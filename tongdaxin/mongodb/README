The pythong code demonstrate how to load the data from tongdaxin into mongodb

Even the mongoimport is very fast
 mongoimport --uri "mongodb://192.168.1.75:27017" -d stock -c stockhistory2 --type csv --file /var/tellme/stock/sz/sz399905.day --fields day,o,h,l,c,amount,v

But the issue of mongoimport is, there is no symbol data in csv file. 

Per the current code generated csv, there is space instead of the comma, so, need to keep modify the code to add symbol and replace space with comma

 sed 's/\ /,/g' sz399974.day|sed 's/^/399974,/g' > /var/tmp/sz399974.day

Do it to support the mongodbimport
