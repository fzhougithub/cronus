  The Shard Class:

    enableSharding                             Enables sharding on a specific database. Uses the enableSharding command
    commitReshardCollection                    Commits the current reshardCollection on a given collection
    abortReshardCollection                     Abort the current reshardCollection on a given collection
    shardCollection                            Enables sharding for a collection. Uses the shardCollection command
    reshardCollection                          Enables sharding for a collection. Uses the reshardCollection command
    status                                     Prints a formatted report of the sharding configuration and the information regarding existing chunks in a sharded cluster. The default behavior suppresses the detailed chunk information if the total number of chunks is greater than or equal to 20.
    addShard                                   Adds a shard to a sharded cluster. Uses the addShard command
    addShardToZone                             Associates a shard to a zone. Uses the addShardToZone command
    addShardTag                                3.4+ only. Calls addShardTag for a sharded DB. Aliases to sh.addShardToZone().
    updateZoneKeyRange                         Associates a range of shard keys to a zone. Uses the updateZoneKeyRange command
    addTagRange                                3.4+ only. Adds a tag range for a sharded DB. This method aliases to sh.updateZoneKeyRange()
    removeRangeFromZone                        3.4+ only. Removes an association between a range of shard keys and a zone.
    removeTagRange                             3.4+ only. Removes tag range for a sharded DB. Aliases to sh.removeRangeFromZone
    removeShardFromZone                        3.4+ only. Removes the association between a shard and a zone. Uses the removeShardFromZone command
    removeShardTag                             3.4+ only. Removes a shard tag for a sharded DB. Aliases to sh.removeShardFromZone
    enableAutoSplit                            Enables auto-splitting for the sharded cluster. Calls update on the config.settings collection
    disableAutoSplit                           Disables auto-splitting for the sharded cluster. Calls update on the config.settings collection
    splitAt                                    Divides an existing chunk into two chunks using a specific value of the shard key as the dividing point. Uses the split command
    splitFind                                  Splits a chunk at the shard key value specified by the query at the median. Uses the split command
    moveChunk                                  Moves the chunk that contains the document specified by the query to the destination shard. Uses the moveChunk command
    balancerCollectionStatus                   Returns information on whether the chunks of a sharded collection are balanced. Uses the balancerCollectionStatus command
    enableBalancing                            Activates the sharded collection balancer process.
    disableBalancing                           Disable balancing on a single collection in a sharded database. Does not affect balancing of other collections in a sharded cluster.
    getBalancerState                           Returns true when the balancer is enabled and false if the balancer is disabled. This does not reflect the current state of balancing operations: use sh.isBalancerRunning() to check the balancerâ€™s current state.
    isBalancerRunning                          Returns true if the balancer process is currently running and migrating chunks and false if the balancer process is not running. Uses the balancerStatus command
    startBalancer                              Enables the balancer. Uses the balancerStart command
    stopBalancer                               Disables the balancer. uses the balancerStop command
    setBalancerState                           Calls sh.startBalancer if state is true, otherwise calls sh.stopBalancer
    getShardedDataDistribution                 Returns data-size distribution information for all existing sharded collections
    startAutoMerger                            Globally enable auto-merger (active only if balancer is up)
    stopAutoMerger                             Globally disable auto-merger
    isAutoMergerEnabled                        Returns whether the auto-merger is enabled
    disableAutoMerger                          Disable auto-merging on one collection
    enableAutoMerger                           Re-enable auto-merge on one collection
    checkMetadataConsistency                   Returns a cursor with information about metadata inconsistencies
    shardAndDistributeCollection               Shards a collection and then immediately reshards the collection to the same shard key.
    moveCollection                             Moves a single unsharded collection to a different shard.
    abortMoveCollection                        Abort the current moveCollection operation on a given collection
    unshardCollection                          Unshard the given collection and move all data to the given shard.
    abortUnshardCollection                     Abort the current unshardCollection operation on a given collection
