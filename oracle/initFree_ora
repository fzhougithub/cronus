Here’s a table explaining the parameters defined in your initFREE.ora file:

​​Parameter​​	​​Description​​
FREE.__data_transfer_cache_size	Internal parameter for Oracle's data transfer cache size. Typically not user-configurable.
FREE.__datamemory_area_size	Internal parameter for Oracle's data memory area size. Typically not user-configurable.
FREE.__db_cache_size	The size of the database buffer cache, which stores data blocks read from datafiles. This is a critical parameter for performance.
FREE.__inmemory_ext_roarea	Internal parameter for Oracle's In-Memory extension read-only area. Typically not user-configurable.
FREE.__inmemory_ext_rwarea	Internal parameter for Oracle's In-Memory extension read-write area. Typically not user-configurable.
FREE.__java_pool_size	The size of the Java pool, which is used for Java execution and storage. If you are not using Java in the database, this can be set to 0.
FREE.__large_pool_size	The size of the large pool, which is used for shared server processes, parallel execution, and RMAN backups.
FREE.__oracle_base	The Oracle Base directory, which is the root directory for Oracle software and database files. This is set from the environment variable ORACLE_BASE.
FREE.__pga_aggregate_target	The target size for the PGA (Program Global Area) aggregate, which is used for sorting, hashing, and other operations in memory.
FREE.__sga_target	The target size for the SGA (System Global Area), which includes shared memory structures like the database buffer cache, shared pool, and redo log buffer.
FREE.__shared_io_pool_size	The size of the shared I/O pool, which is used for shared storage services like Oracle ASM (Automatic Storage Management).
FREE.__shared_pool_size	The size of the shared pool, which stores SQL statements, execution plans, and other shared data structures.
FREE.__streams_pool_size	The size of the Streams pool, which is used for Oracle Streams (a feature for data replication and messaging). If not using Streams, this can be set to 0.
FREE.__unified_pga_pool_size	The size of the unified PGA pool, which is used for unified memory management in Oracle.
FREE._instance_recovery_bloom_filter_size	Internal parameter for Oracle's instance recovery bloom filter size. Typically not user-configurable.
*.compatible	Specifies the compatibility level of the database. This ensures backward compatibility with earlier versions of Oracle. In this case, it is set to 23.6.0.
*.control_files	Specifies the location of the control files, which are critical for database recovery and management.
*.db_block_size	The size of a database block, which is the smallest unit of data storage in the database. In this case, it is set to 8192 bytes (8 KB).
*.db_name	The name of the database instance. In this case, it is set to FREE.
*.diagnostic_dest	Specifies the directory for diagnostic data, such as alert logs and trace files. In this case, it is set to /opt/oracle.
*.dispatchers	Configures the Oracle Net listeners (dispatchers) for shared server connections. The format is (PROTOCOL=TCP) (SERVICE=FREEXDB), where FREEXDB is the service name.
*.enable_pluggable_database	Enables or disables pluggable databases (PDBs). In this case, it is set to true, meaning PDBs are enabled.
*.local_listener	Specifies the local listener for the database. In this case, it is set to LISTENER_FREE, which should be defined in the tnsnames.ora file.
*.nls_language	Specifies the default language for the database. In this case, it is set to AMERICAN.
*.nls_territory	Specifies the default territory (region) for the database. In this case, it is set to AMERICA.
*.open_cursors	Specifies the maximum number of cursors (SQL statements) that a session can have open simultaneously. In this case, it is set to 300.
*.pga_aggregate_target	Specifies the target size for the PGA aggregate memory. In this case, it is set to 197m (197 MB).
*.processes	Specifies the maximum number of processes that can connect to the database simultaneously. In this case, it is set to 200.
*.remote_login_passwordfile	Specifies whether a password file is used for remote authentication. The value EXCLUSIVE means only one database can use the password file.
*.sga_target	Specifies the total size of the SGA (System Global Area). In this case, it is set to 591m (591 MB).
*.undo_tablespace	Specifies the undo tablespace to be used for managing undo data (used for transactions and read consistency). In this case, it is set to UNDOTBS1.
