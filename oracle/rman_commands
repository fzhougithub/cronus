Here are some examples of using RMAN with different options based on your requirements:

### 1. Connect to the target database without a recovery catalog

rman target / nocatalog

This command connects RMAN to the target database using OS authentication (assuming you're logged in as the Oracle owner) and does not use a recovery catalog.

### 2. Connect to the target database with a recovery catalog

rman target sys/password@target_db catalog rman/rmanpass@rcat_db

Replace `sys/password@target_db` with your target database credentials and `rman/rmanpass@rcat_db` with your recovery catalog credentials.

### 3. Execute commands from a script file

rman target / cmdfile=/u01/scripts/full_backup.rman log=/u01/logs/backup.log

This runs the RMAN script located at `/u01/scripts/full_backup.rman` and logs the output to `/u01/logs/backup.log`.

### 4. Perform a full database backup with logging

rman target / log=/u01/logs/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).log <<EOF
BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
DELETE OBSOLETE;
EOF

This performs a full database backup along with archivelogs and deletes obsolete backups. The log file is named with the current date.

### 5. Use variables in an RMAN script

rman target / using "BACKUP_DIR='/u01/backups'" <<EOF
VARIABLE backup_location VARCHAR2(100);
EXEC :backup_location := '${BACKUP_DIR}';
BACKUP DATABASE FORMAT '${backup_location}/%U';
EOF

This passes a shell variable `BACKUP_DIR` into the RMAN script and uses it to define the backup location.

### 6. Check syntax of an RMAN script without execution

rman checksyntax cmdfile=/u01/scripts/restore_script.rman

This checks the syntax of the RMAN script without actually executing it.

### 7. Connect to an auxiliary database for duplication

rman target sys/pass@prod auxiliary sys/pass@aux_db <<EOF
DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE TO aux_db FROM ACTIVE DATABASE;
EOF

This duplicates the production database to an auxiliary database using the active database (no need to shut it down).

### 8. Debug an RMAN session

rman target / debug trace=/u01/logs/rman_debug.log

This enables debugging mode and writes debug information to the specified trace file.

### 9. Use a recovery catalog script

rman target / catalog rman/rmanpass@rcat script "daily_backup"

This executes a pre-stored catalog script named `daily_backup`.

### 10. Set a timeout for RMAN operations

rman target / timeout=3600 <<EOF
BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 0 DATABASE;
EOF

This sets a timeout of 3600 seconds (1 hour) for the RMAN operations in the script.

Remember to replace placeholders like `password`, `target_db`, and paths with your actual database credentials and system paths. These examples cover common use cases for RMAN options.
